# Objective
# In this challenge, we practice calculating a probability. 

# In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice,
# find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

a = 1 / 9
b = 1 / 6
c = 2 / 3
d = 5 / 6

# We have two rolls of 6 numerical dice. 6 x 6 = 36 or 6 ** 2 = 36
# In this question we are asked how many of compinations do we have when the sum of two rolls returns 6.

# (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1). 

# But also each die need to be different.

# (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)

# 4 / 36, when silplify it by 4 it is probability 1 / 9.

# a = 1 / 9
