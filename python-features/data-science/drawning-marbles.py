# Objective
# In this challenge, we practice calculating the Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.

# A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. 
# Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
# If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?


a = 1 / 12
b = 7 / 12
c = 1 / 6
d = 2 / 3

# A bag has 3 + 4 = 7 marbles
# It is 3 / 7 to get red and 4 / 7 to get blue

# If the first is red we drawn the second marble from the 6 marbles then the probabilty is 4 / 6.
# Now simplyfy to 2 / 3

# d = 2 / 3
