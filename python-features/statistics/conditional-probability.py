# Objective
# In this challenge, we practice calculating the Conditional Probability. 

# Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

a = 1 / 3
b = 1 / 2
c = 2 / 3
d = 1 / 9

# I would say fifty - fifty, because the second child could be a girl or a boy.

# Boy Boy
# Boy Girl

# Otherwise the correct answer here is 1 / 3, 
# because we do not know which of the child is the boy from the condition.

# Boy Boy
# Boy Girl
# Girl Boy

# final answer is a = 1 / 3
