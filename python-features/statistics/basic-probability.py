# Objective
# In this challenge, we practice calculating a probability. 

# In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, 
# find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

a = 2 / 3
b = 5 / 6
c = 1 / 4
d = 1 / 6

# min sum of dices we expect to be greater then 9.
# (4/6), (5/6), (6/6), (5/5), (6/4), (6/5)

# the number of other permutations is 36 - 6 = 30, otherwise 30 / 36

# simplify by 6 define the answer b = 5 / 6
