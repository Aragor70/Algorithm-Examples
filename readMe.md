## Programming algorithms

This section is dedicated to return algorithms, the most examples will be provide in JavaScript and Python languages.
Please note me any qestions for other languages recommendation.


This section helps you with the exams, interviews or exploring cases of your own curiosity I have been faced with.

I encourage you to send your feedback.
